# angular-dash
A Dashboard Sample created in Angular 1.5

Hey you, random person who accidentaly fell in this place, be welcome! I hope you have a good time reading my attempt to learn Angular 1.5.

## Running in your local machine

After clonning this project, you will have to use some package manager to download the dependecies. I do prefer using Yarn, but it's your call.
Once the dependencies are ok, you must to start some server on your project folder, in my case it is angular-http-server.

All set? You are ready to go!

P.S.The most updated version of this project will always be in Develop branch, so make sure to checkout if nothing is working (it is suposed to be!!!).
